Here are a few of the skills that I have learned from UMD or Self-Exploration and a project for each || *Some UMD projects are not on github*
- Python
  - Mario Kart Stats Project - A large-scale project used to keep track of stats for Mario Kart Wii for my friends and I, compiles data into a pdf to showcase our skills against one another
